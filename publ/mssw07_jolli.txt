This paper examines the complexity of hybrid logics over transitive
frames and transitive trees. We show that satisfiability over transitive
frames for the hybrid language extended with downarrow is NEXP-complete.
This is in contrast to undecidability of satisfiability over arbitrary
frames for this language [Areces, Blackburn, Marx 1999]. We also show
that adding @ or the past modality leads to undecidability over
transitive frames, but not over transitive trees, where we show the
richest language to be nonelementarily decidable. Moreover, we establish
2EXP and EXP upper bounds for satisfiability over transitive frames and
transitive trees, respectively, for the hybrid Until/Since language. An
EXP lower bound is shown to hold for the modal Until language over both
frame classes.
