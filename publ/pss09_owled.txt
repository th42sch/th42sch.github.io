The current OWL 2 specification provides mechanisms for importing whole
ontologies. This paper discusses the import of only a module of an
external ontology, which is specified by a set of terms (classes and
properties) and defined in such a way that it contains "all knowledge" of
the external ontology about these terms. We discuss possible design
choices for such an import mechanism, based on the well-understood
properties of logic-based module extraction techniques.
