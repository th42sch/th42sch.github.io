There are various techniques to specifying a module of an ontology that
covers all knowledge about a given set of terms. These differ with respect
to the size of the module, the complexity of its computation, and certain
robustness properties. It is the aim of this paper to compare these
different kinds of modules with respect to their properties and to give
guidelines on how to choose "the right kind of module".
