Hybrid logic is an expressive specification language, but has an
undecidable satisfiability problem in general. In this paper, we restrict
the set of Boolean operators to monotone operators (for instance conjunction and disjunction)
and the underlying frames to commonly used acyclic frames, namely transitive trees, total transitive
trees, linear orders, and the natural numbers. We show that, under these restrictions,
satisfiability is decidable for 16 fragments arising from different combinations
of modal and hybrid operators. More precisely, we categorise these fragments to be
PSPACE-complete, NP-complete or tractable, where the latter cases are contained in
detLOGCFL or complete for NC1.
