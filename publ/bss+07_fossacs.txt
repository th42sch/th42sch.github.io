In a seminal paper from 1985, Sistla and Clarke showed that
satisfiability for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is either NP-complete or
PSPACE-complete, depending on the set of temporal operators used. If, in
contrast, the set of propositional operators is restricted, the
complexity may decrease. This paper undertakes a systematic study of
satisfiability for LTL formulas over restricted sets of propositional and
temporal operators. Since every propositional operator corresponds to a
Boolean function, there exist infinitely many propositional operators. In
order to systematically cover all possible sets of them, we use Post's
lattice. With its help, we determine the computational complexity of LTL
satisfiability for all combinations of temporal operators and all but two
classes of propositional functions. Each of these infinitely many
problems is shown to be either PSPACE-complete, NP-complete, or in P.
