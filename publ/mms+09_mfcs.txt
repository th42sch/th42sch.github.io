The satisfiability problem of hybrid logics with the downarrow binder is
known to be undecidable. This initiated a research program on decidable
and tractable fragments. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
restricting the propositional part of the language on decidability and on
the complexity of the satisfiability problem over arbitrary, transitive,
total frames, and frames based on equivalence relations. We also consider
different sets of modal and hybrid operators. We trace the border of
decidability and give the precise complexity of most fragments, in
particular for all fragments including negation. For the monotone
fragments, we are able to distinguish the easy from the hard cases,
depending on the allowed set of operators.
