Efficiently extracting a module from a given ontology that captures
all the ontology's knowledge about a set of specified terms is
well-understood task. It can be solved, for instance, by
locality-based modules.

In contrast, extracting *all* modules of an ontology is computationally
difficult because there can be exponentially many. However, it is
reasonable to assume that, by revealing the modular structure of an
ontology, we can obtain information about its topicality,
connectedness, structure, superfluous parts, or agreement between
actual and intended modeling. Furthermore, incremental reasoning
makes use of a number of, although not all possible, modules of an
ontology.

Chances are that real-life ontologies have significantly fewer
modules than the worst cases. We report on experiments to obtain or estimate this number
and to evaluate the modular structure of an ontology where we
succeeded to compute it. In that evaluation, we look at the number and
sizes of the modules, as well as the relation between module sizes and number and
sizes of signatures that lead to the module.
