Undecidability of Multi-modal Hybrid Logics

This paper establishes undecidability of satisfiability for
multi-modal logic equipped with the hybrid downarrow-binder,
with respect to frame classes over which the same language
with only one modality is decidable. This is in contrast to the
usual behaviour of many modal and hybrid logics, whose uni-modal
and multi-modal versions do not differ in terms of decidability
and, quite often, complexity. The results from this paper
apply to a wide range of frame classes including temporally and
epistemically relevant ones.
