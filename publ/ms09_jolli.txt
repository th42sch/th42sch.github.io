This paper examines and classifies the computational complexity of model
checking and satisfiability for hybrid logics over frames with
equivalence relations. The considered languages contain all possible
combinations of the downarrow binder, the existential binder, the
satisfaction operator, and the global modality, ranging from the minimal
hybrid language to very expressive languages. For model checking, we
separate polynomial-time solvable from PSPACE-complete cases, and for
satisfiability, we exhibit cases complete for NP, PSpace, NExpTime, and
even N2ExpTime. Our analysis includes the versions of all these languages
without atomic propositions, and also complete frames.
