<h1>Description Logics: a Nice Family of Logics</h1>

This is the course material to an introductory course given at <a href="http://www.esslli2012.pl/">ESSLLI
2012</a>, called

<h2>Description Logics: a Nice Family of Logics</h2>

by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/">Uli Sattler</a> and <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~ts">Thomas
Schneider</a>. It is an introduction to Description Logics, aimed at
anybody with a basic background in computer science or related
areas. We tried to give a basic understanding of what Description
Logics are, how they related to other logics and the Web Ontology
Language OWL, sketched two approaches to reasoning, looked at some
complexity results, and closed by discussing notions and applications
of modularity and justifications.  <p>

Here is a table of contents with links to slides:

<ul>

 <li> <a href="slides/day1_intro_a.pdf"> Introduction:</a> syntax and semantics of ALC 
 <li> <a href="slides/day1_intro_b.pdf"> Introduction:</a>
 relationship between reasoning problems and relationships between
 Description Logics, First Order Logic, and Modal Logic
 <li> A <a href="slides/day2_tableau.pdf"> tableau algorithm </a> for
 ALC, and how to extend it for DLs with inverse roles and cardinality restrictions
 <li> An <a href="slides/day3_automata.pdf"> automata-based algorithm  </a> for
 ALC, and how to extend it for DLs with inverse roles
 <li> Some <a href="slides/day4_complexity.pdf">complexity</a> and
 undecidability results
 <li> EL, a <a href="slides/day4_el.pdf">polynomial DL </a>
 <li> <a href="slides/day5_modularity.pdf"> Modularity and modules</a>
 in DLs
   <li> <a href="slides/day5_justifications+links.pdf">Justifications</a>
 for explanation and repair of entailments 
</ul>
  
The course was designed for ESSLLI 2012, but we reused existing
material and mention numerous results that are <b>not</b> our own, in
particular results by  Franz Baader, Samantha Bail, 
Sebastian Brandt, Bernardo Cuenca-Grau, Yevgeny Kazakov, Boris Konev, Carsten Lutz, Matthew
  Horridge, Ian Horrocks,   Bijan Parsia, Boontawee Suntisrivaraporn,  Stephan Tobies, Dirk
  Walther, Frank Wolter.
